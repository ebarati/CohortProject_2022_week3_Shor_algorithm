## Explain to a layperson the technical problem you solved in this exercise:
Shors factoring algorithm is one of the first (and few) textbook quantum algorithms with known exponential speedup.  In other words, it computes quantumly
something that is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to compute classically. Peter Shor developed this algorithm to find the prime factors of an 
integer.  Two features of Shor's algorithm render its quantum advantage in factoring - the quantum Fourier transform, and repeated squaring by modular 
exponentiation.  Three common public-key cryptography schemes in use today are vulnerable to quantum computer breakage (via Shor's algorithm) - RSA, Finite Field 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange. 

## Explain or provide examples of the types of real-world problems this solution can solve.
In seeing not only the good side - but also the bad side - of quantum computing, it is 

## Identify at least one potential customer for this solution - ie: a business who has this problem and would consider paying to have this problem solved.
